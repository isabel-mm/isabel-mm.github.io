## 💡 About me

I work at the intersection of theoretical linguistics and computational methods. My research focuses on:

- Automatic term extraction
- Domain-specific corpus design and representativeness assessment
- Supervised approaches for linguistic pattern detection
- Authorship analysis and stylometry

I am particularly interested in how linguistic theory can inform computational modelling, and in the epistemological implications of technological mediation in language research.

## 🔬 Current work

My current work aims to:

- Develop a theoretical–computational model of terminology
- Build a reproducible pipeline for term extraction
- Propose quantitative methods to evaluate terminological representativeness
