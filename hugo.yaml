    title: "About me"
    content: |
      I am a predoctoral researcher in Linguistics. My work lies at the interface between linguistic theory and computational methods, with a particular interest in **terminology**, **automatic term extraction**, **stylometry**, and **corpus linguistics**.

      I value reproducible research workflows: corpus design, annotation, evaluation, and quantitative analysis with linguistic interpretation.
